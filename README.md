Node Mock - Simple Yet Powerful Mocking Framework for NodeJs
============================================================

NodeMock is a very simple to use mocking framework which can be used to 
mock functions in JavaScript objects. 
NodeMock creates mock methods in less code with more expressive manner.

I have passed the reins of maintenance for this project to
[Curtis Schlak](http://curtis.schlak.com). You can find new changes to it
over at [nodemock](https://github.com/realistschuckle/nodemock).
